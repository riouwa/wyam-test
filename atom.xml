		<title>Today I started at Target</title>
		<updated>2017-08-29T02:20:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Today marks a pretty big change in my career as I transition to a new software engineering role at &lt;a href="http://target.com"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That change comes after a 7 year stint at General Mills where I worked right out of college. I had an amazing time there and made lifelong friends. I'm hoping to continue the trend of working at great places! If you're looking for an awesome place to work, I encourage you to reach out to me for a referral or &lt;a href="http://careers.generalmills.com/job-search-results/?keyword=devops"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt; at General Mills if you want to work on DevOps stuff with a .NET stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new role is on an internal product team where I'll be working on Node.js apps with Angular and React front-ends. It'll be a pretty big shift from doing primarily Microsoft stack and ASP.NET/C# to full stack JavaScript. Of course, I'm no stranger to these technologies but rather than developing in those stacks on side projects I'll be doing it full-time which should help me learn it a lot more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also excited because Target has a clear commitment towards open source and the greater community, being a major sponsor of almost every local conference and encouraging OSS contributions from its engineers. Expect to see more frequent blog posts and maybe even some open source project work as I take on my new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My love for .NET won't be lost though, I'll still be plugging away at KTOMG, migrating to .NET Core and working on .NET Core OSS projects. I'm also trying to learn F# this year. On that note, I hope to come up with a consistent schedule to stream &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/kamranicus"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; so you can follow me there for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
